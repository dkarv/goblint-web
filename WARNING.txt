=========
DO NOT USE OR FIX FIRST:
=========
do not use bootstrap collapse: some other library seems to destroy it's functionality.
Collapsing or uncollapsing works only once, then clicking the trigger stops working

=========
Javascript changes:
=========
do a "make clean" after each change, otherwise the binded js files are cached somehow
